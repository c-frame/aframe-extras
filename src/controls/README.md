# Controls

Extensible movement/rotation/hotkey controls, with support for a variety of input devices.

- **movement-controls**: Collection of locomotion controls, which can switch between input devices as they become active. Automatically includes the following components:
  + **keyboard-controls**: WASD + arrow controls for movement, and more.
  + **touch-controls**: Touch screen (or Cardboard button) to move forward.
  + **gamepad-controls**: Gamepad-based rotation and movement.
  + **trackpad-controls**: Trackpad-based movement.
- **checkpoint-controls**: Move to checkpoints created with the `checkpoint` component. *Not included by default with `movement-controls`, but may be added as shown in examples.*
- **nipple-controls**: Virtual joysticks for rotation and movement on touch devices. This is using the [nipplejs](https://github.com/yoannmoinet/nipplejs) library.

For the Cardboard button, this was tested and working on both Chrome Android and Safari iPhone with aframe 1.4.2.
On iPhone you need `â‰¤a-scene vr-mode-ui="cardboardModeEnabled:true">` for the VR button to show up.
On Chrome Android you also need the `cardboardModeEnabled:true` option but this is to register the selectstart/selectend event listener to properly use the Cardboard button.
Be aware that the selectstart/selectend event listener has the side effect to move forward when you press the trigger button with VR controllers.

## Usage

The `movement-controls` component requires the use of a camera "rig" wrapping the camera element. The rig may be assigned any position within your scene, and should be placed at ground level. The camera should only have height offset (used for devices without positional tracking) such as `0 1.6 0`.

Basic movement:

```html
<a-entity id="rig"
          movement-controls
          position="25 0 25">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

With checkpoints, and other input methods disabled:

```html
<a-entity id="rig"
          movement-controls="controls: checkpoint"
          checkpoint-controls="mode: animate">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true">
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

With gamepad, keyboard and nipple controls with virtual joysticks:

```html
<a-entity id="rig"
          movement-controls="controls: gamepad,keyboard,nipple"
          nipple-controls="mode: static">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true">
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

The default for `nipple-controls` is two joysticks and `dynamic` mode (joysticks hidden, not on fixed position).
The `static` (joysticks visible, fixed position) and `semi` modes are also supported.
If you only want the joystick for movement on the right, you can use:

```html
nipple-controls="mode: static; lookJoystickEnabled: false; moveJoystickPosition: right"
```

With navigation mesh:

```html
<a-entity id="rig" movement-controls="constrainToNavMesh: true">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true">
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

With physics-based movement.

> **WARNING** *Using physics for movement is unstable and performs poorly. When preventing players from passing through obstacles, use a navigation mesh instead whenever possible.*

```html
<a-entity id="rig" movement-controls kinematic-body>
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls="pointerLockEnabled: true"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

## Options

| Property           | Default | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| enabled            | true    | Enables/disables movement controls. |
| controls           | gamepad, keyboard, touch | Ordered list of controls to be injected. |
| speed              | 0.3      | Movement speed. |
| fly                | false    | Whether vertical movement is enabled.               |
| constrainToNavMesh | false    | Whether to use navigation system to clamp movement. |
| camera             | [camera] | Camera element used for heading of the camera rig.  |

## Customizing movement-controls

To implement your custom controls, define a component and override one or more methods:

| Method                                             | Type     | Required |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| isVelocityActive() : boolean                       | Movement | Yes |
| getVelocityDelta(deltaMS : number) : THREE.Vector3 | Movement | No  |
| getPositionDelta(deltaMS : number) : THREE.Vector3 | Movement | No  |

Example:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('custom-controls', {
  isVelocityActive: function () {
    return Math.random() < 0.25;
  },
  getPositionDelta: function () {
    return new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0);
  }
});
```

## Other Controls

I've written standalone components for several other control components. These do not work with `movement-controls`, and are older and less well maintained.

- [gamepad-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-gamepad-controls): A more advanced standalone gamepad controller than the version in this package.
- [keyboard-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-keyboard-controls): A more advanced standalone keyboard controller than the version in this package.

## Mobile + Desktop Input Devices

Connect input devices from your desktop to your mobile phone with WebRTC, using [ProxyControls.js](https://proxy-controls.donmccurdy.com).

## Mobile Gamepad Support
