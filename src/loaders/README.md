# Loaders

Loaders for various 3D model types. All are trivial wrappers around one of the [many THREE.js loader classes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/loaders).

- **collada-model-legacy**: Loader for COLLADA (`.dae`) format, removed from A-Frame core with v0.9.0 release. Where possible, use the `gltf-model` component that ships with A-Frame instead.
- **gltf-model-legacy**: Loader for glTF 1.0 format, removed from A-Frame core with v0.7.0 release. For glTF 2.0, use the `gltf-model` component that ships with A-Frame instead.
- **object-model**: Loader for THREE.js .JSON format, generally containing multiple meshes or an entire scene. Where possible, use the `gltf-model` component that ships with A-Frame instead.
- **fbx-model**: Loader for FBX format.
- **animation-mixer**: Controls animations embedded in a glTF model.

## Usage

```html
<!-- FBX -->
<a-entity fbx-model="src: url(my-model.fbx);"></a-entity>
```

THREE.js models often need to be scaled down. Example:

```html
<a-entity scale="0.5 0.5 0.5" fbx-model="src: url(my-model.fbx);">
</a-entity>
```

## Animation

> Example by [Joe Campbell](https://github.com/rexraptor08) ([source](https://github.com/rexraptor08/animation-controls)).

glTF and three.js models also support animation, through the `animation-mixer` component. All animations will play by default, or you can specify
an animation and its duration:

| Property          | Default  | Description                                               |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| clip              | *        | Name of the animation clip(s) to play. Accepts wildcards. |
| duration          | AUTO     | Duration of the animation, in seconds.                    |
| crossFadeDuration | 0        | Duration of cross-fades between clips, in seconds.        |
| loop              | repeat   | `once`, `repeat`, or `pingpong`. In `repeat` and `pingpong` modes, the clip plays once plus the specified number of repetitions. For `pingpong`, every second clip plays in reverse. |
| repetitions       | Infinity | Number of times to play the clip, in addition to the first play. Repetitions are ignored for `loop: once`. |
| timeScale         | 1        | Scaling factor for playback speed. A value of 0 causes the animation to pause. Negative values cause the animation to play backwards. |
| clampWhenFinished | false        | If true, halts the animation at the last frame. |


A list of available animations can usually be found by inspecting the model file or its documentation. All animations will play by default. To play only a specific set of animations, use wildcards: `animation-mixer="clip: run_*"`.

### Animation Events

The `animation-mixer` component emits events at certain points in the animation cycle.

| Event              | Details               | Description                                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| animation-loop     | `action`, `loopDelta` | Emitted when a single loop of the animation clip has finished. |
| animation-finished | `action`, `direction` | Emitted when all loops of an animation clip have finished.     |
